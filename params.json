It allows you to specify\r\nan unbiased hyperplane. It also allows you to access the learnt\r\nhyperplane after training.\r\n\r\nSee the svmlight website (http://svmlight.joachims.org/) for full\r\ndetails. \r\n\r\nExample of use:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> f = DocumentFactory()\r\n>>> docs = [f.new(x.split()) for x in [\r\n...         \"this is a nice long document\",\r\n...         \"this is another nice long document\",\r\n...         \"this is rather a short document\",\r\n...         \"a horrible document\",\r\n...         \"another horrible document\"]]\r\n>>> l = Learner()\r\n>>> model = l.learn(docs, [1, 1, 1, -1, -1])\r\n>>> judgments = [model.classify(d) for d in docs]\r\n>>> print model.plane, model.bias\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuilding from source\r\n====================\r\n\r\nBuilding requires Cython to be installed. Type\r\n```\r\n$ python setup.py build\r\n$ python setup.py install\r\n```\r\nin the root directory to build and install.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThe original svmlight code is included in the lib directory for ease\r\nof building.
